description: Developed with Sarah Her, this NLP project uses a Support Vector Machines model to automatically assign keywords from a controlled vocabulary to law review articles based on article abstracts. The dataset used to train and test the model draws on articles from the <em>Boston College Law Review</em>, the <em>Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review</em>, the <em>Boston College International and Comparative Law Review</em>, the <em>Boston College Journal of Law & Social Justice</em>, and the <em>Boston College Third World Law Journal</em>.
