description: In this project, I designed and built a Postgresql database using the <em>311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present</em> dataset published by NYC OpenData. This data includes information on the time, location, and nature of all service requests made to the 311 non-emergency help line in New York City from 2010 to the present.
